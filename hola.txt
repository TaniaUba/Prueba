'Til I hear you sing once more
And sometimes at night time
I dream that you are there
But wake holding nothing
But the empty air
The day starts
The day ends
Time crawls by
Night steals in pacing the floor

//

Who knows when love begins
Who knows what makes it start
One day it's simply there
Alive inside your hear
It slips into your thoughts
It infiltrates your soul
It takes you by surprise
Then seizes full control
Try to deny it
And try to protest
But love won't let you go
Once you've been possessed
